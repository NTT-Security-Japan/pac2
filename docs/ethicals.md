# Ethical Considerations

This document outlines the ethical use and operational boundaries of PAC2. It emphasizes non-exploitative utilization, user consent requirements, and the detection capabilities for legacy packages.

## 1. Scope of Permissions

Our program is designed to operate strictly within the bounds of users' permission. It does not exploit vulnerabilities or extend its reach beyond what is explicitly allowed by the user. The core principle is to ensure that all operations conducted through the Power Automate Platform are legitimate and within the following permissions:

Access to user data is strictly limited to what is necessary for the program's operation.
The program does not attempt to elevate its privileges beyond the user has granted.

## 2. User Consent for Commands

To uphold user autonomy and security, PAC2 adheres to a strict policy requiring user approval for any commands sent from the server before execution. This mechanism is designed to:

Prevent unauthorized actions by ensuring that all PAC2 commands are pre-approved by the user.
Provide transparency, allowing users to understand and control what actions are taken on their behalf.

## 3. Detection of Legacy Packages

The integrity of the software environment is crucial for maintaining trust and security. Our program provides detection feature for legacy packages generated by PAC2, using the [Yara rule](../utils/powerautomate_c2.yara) located in the utils directory. This feature scans for known signatures of legacy packages to detect any potential unwanted PAC2 legacy packages.
